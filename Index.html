        <h2>My Experience of Moving to a New City</h2>
        <p>Moving to a new city is a significant life change that can bring a whirlwind of emotions. When I decided to relocate from my hometown Beijing to New York, I felt a mix of excitement and anxiety. On one hand, I was thrilled at the prospect of new opportunities, adventures, and the chance to meet new people. On the other hand, I was overwhelmed by the uncertainty of embracing to a whole other culture and speaking to another language.</p>

        <p>The first few weeks after my move were particularly challenging. I felt isolated and disoriented, struggling to navigate the city's public transportation system and missing the comfort of my old routine. The part of New York I saw is not what I thought it was before I came abroad: street was full of rat, and the nasty smell. I lived in a room with only half a window, yet it faces north. During the winter, the brightest hour of the day is 4pm! And soon the sun went down. </p>

        <p>I was in a down mood for almost a year, but gradually I learned that it was normal to feel this way during a significant transition. I started journaling about my experiences, which helped me process my emotions and recognize that feeling lost was part of the journey.</p>
