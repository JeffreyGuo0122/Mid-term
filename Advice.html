        <h2>Advice and Resources for Navigating Major Life Changes</h2>
        <h3>1. Set Small, Achievable Goals</h3>
        <p>Break down the overwhelming aspects of your new situation into manageable tasks. This could be as simple as exploring a new area or trying a local restaurant each week.</p>
        <h3>2. Seek Community and Connection</h3>
        <p>Look for local groups or clubs related to your interests. Websites like Meetup or community boards can help you find events and activities where you can meet new people.</p>
        <h3>3. Practice Self-Compassion</h3>
        <p>Allow yourself to feel the emotions that come with change. It’s okay to miss your old life or feel uncertain. Journaling or talking to a trusted friend can help you process these feelings.</p>
        <h3>4. Explore Support Networks</h3>
        <p>If you’re feeling particularly overwhelmed, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor. Online platforms like BetterHelp or local mental health services can provide valuable support.</p>
        <h3>5. Resource List:</h3>
